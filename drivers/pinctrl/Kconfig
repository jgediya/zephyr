	  This option must be selected by drivers that require access to the device
	  register address. This can happen, for example, if certain pin control
	  actions are device dependent or require access to device specific
	  registers

	bool
	help
	  This option can be selected if the pin control configuration defined by
	  a driver has to be accessed externally. This can happen, for example, when
	  dynamic pin control is enabled or in testing environments.
